### System Design

**What is System Design?**
- **Definition**: Process of defining architecture, interfaces, and data for a system to meet specific requirements.
- **Purpose**: Satisfies business needs through coherent and efficient systems.
- **Approach**: Systematic, from infrastructure to data storage.

**Importance of System Design**
- **Business Requirements**: Defines solutions that meet business needs.
- **Early Decisions**: Crucial early decisions that are difficult to correct later.
- **Manage Changes**: Facilitates reasoning about and managing architectural changes as the system evolves.

### IP Addresses

**Definition**: A unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
- **Purpose**: Allows information to be sent between devices on a network.
- **Function**: Differentiates between different computers, routers, and websites.

**Versions of IP Addresses**

1. **IPv4**
   - **Protocol**: Original Internet Protocol.
   - **Format**: 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation.
   - **Capacity**: ~4 billion IP addresses.
   - **Example**: `102.22.192.181`

2. **IPv6**
   - **Protocol**: New protocol introduced in 1998.
   - **Format**: 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation.
   - **Capacity**: ~340e+36 IP addresses.
   - **Example**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

**Types of IP Addresses**

1. **Public IP**
   - **Description**: One primary address for the whole network.
   - **Example**: IP address provided to your router by the ISP.

2. **Private IP**
   - **Description**: Unique IP number for each device on a local network.
   - **Example**: IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices.

3. **Static IP**
   - **Description**: Manually created and does not change.
   - **Use Case**: Reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting.
   - **Example**: Typically used for important services requiring stable addresses.

4. **Dynamic IP**
   - **Description**: Changes periodically, assigned by a DHCP server.
   - **Use Case**: Common for consumer equipment and personal use.
   - **Example**: Often used for regular home internet connections.

These notes should give you a concise understanding of system design and IP addresses.
